1. The data were prepared with five fields (Reactant_Br, Reactant_Alkyne, Product, Yield, Reaction_Subclass, and Reaction SMILES)

2. Reaction_Subclass means the bromo-Î±-carbon hybird type at the reactant molecule and the reaction yield

  (1) sp2 and yield = 0% (2N)
  (2) sp2 and yield > 0% (2Y)
  (3)sp3 and yield = 0% (3N) 
  (4)sp3 and yield > 0% (3Y)
